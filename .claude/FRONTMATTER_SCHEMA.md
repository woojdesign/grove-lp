# Thoughts Directory Frontmatter Schema

This document defines the standard YAML frontmatter schema used across all documentation in the `thoughts/` directory. Consistent metadata enables traceability, searchability, and automated tooling.

## Purpose

All markdown documents in `thoughts/` use frontmatter to capture:
- Document type and purpose
- Creation and update history
- Git lineage (commit, branch, repository)
- Attribution (who created/updated)
- Cross-references to related documents
- Organizational metadata (tags, status, tickets)

## Directory Structure

```
thoughts/
├── research/          # Codebase investigation documents
├── plans/             # Implementation planning documents
├── implementation-details/  # Implementation progress tracking
├── reviews/           # Code review documents
└── learning/          # Learning and synthesis documents
```

## File Naming Convention

All files follow: `YYYY-MM-DD-[optional-ticket-id]-kebab-case-description.md`

Examples:
- `2025-10-15-ENG-1234-authentication-flow.md`
- `2025-10-15-database-migration-strategy.md`

```

## Metadata Generation

All agents should use the `hack/spec_metadata.sh` script to generate consistent metadata:

```bash
# Generate metadata for frontmatter
bash hack/spec_metadata.sh
```

This returns:
- Current date/time with timezone
- Git commit hash
- Current branch name
- Repository name
- Researcher/author name (from git config or default)

## Status Values

Standard status progression:
- `draft` - Initial creation, not yet complete
- `in_progress` - Actively being worked on
- `complete` - Finished and verified
- `archived` - Historical reference, no longer active

## Review Status Values

For review documents specifically:
- `approved` - No issues, ready for next phase
- `approved_with_notes` - Can proceed but with observations/suggestions
- `revisions_needed` - Blocking issues that must be addressed

## Cross-References

Use relative paths from repository root:
- ✅ `thoughts/research/2025-10-15-feature.md`
- ❌ `/Users/user/project/thoughts/research/2025-10-15-feature.md`
- ❌ `./research/2025-10-15-feature.md`

## Tags Guidelines

Use lowercase, kebab-case tags organized by:
- **Domain**: `warehouse`, `authentication`, `reporting`
- **Component**: `scanner`, `database`, `ui`, `api`
- **Pattern**: `service-objects`, `active-record`, `stimulus`
- **Type**: `research`, `review`, `learning`

Examples:
```yaml
tags: [warehouse, scanner, barcode-integration, research]
tags: [authentication, jwt, security, implementation]
tags: [learning, rails-patterns, service-objects]
```

## Validation

Documents should be valid if:
1. All required base fields are present
2. Type-specific fields match the doc_type
3. Dates are in ISO 8601 format
4. Cross-references use relative paths
5. Status values match allowed list
6. File name matches YYYY-MM-DD pattern

## Agent Responsibilities

Each agent must:
1. Run `hack/spec_metadata.sh` to gather metadata
2. Use complete metadata (no placeholders)
3. Include appropriate type-specific fields
4. Update `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` on modifications
5. Maintain cross-references between related documents
